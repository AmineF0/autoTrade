Not liking the sound of them being stingy with the VRAM though.Â

    - (level 2) Comment by Archangel959: Right there with you. Still rocking a 1080 and waiting to see where the chips fall.
  - (level 1) Comment by Lo_jak: The way this product stack is looking kinda signals that there is going to be a 5080ti that will sit slap bang between the 5080 and the 5090..... that will be the true "5080".

Title: $53 of NVDA in 2001
Body: Since my wife is tired of hearing about itâ€¦ I thought Iâ€™d share the lucky bet I made on a local tech company a friendâ€™s dad recommended. I figured $50 + the trade fee is about what I could afford. I think I bought 10 Bay Area micro-caps total, hoping one would outperform. 9 went bust, but NVDA is still going strong. ðŸ™‚
