Introduction
============

Context
--------
The financial markets of today bear little resemblance to those of the past century. High-frequency trading, social media's instant dissemination of news, and the democratization of market data have created an environment where traditional analysis methods alone no longer suffice. Traders and investors face an unprecedented challenge: processing vast amounts of heterogeneous data in real-time and maintaining competitive edge in increasingly efficient markets.

Problem Statement
------------------
Market participants struggle with :

1. Information Overload
   The sheer volume of market-relevant data - from traditional news sources to social media sentiment - makes manual analysis impractical.

2. Speed Requirements
   Markets react to information in milliseconds, leaving human traders at a disadvantage when processing complex data streams.

3. Behavioral Biases
   Human decision-making is prone to emotional biases and cognitive limitations, particularly under time pressure and uncertainty.

Objectives
-----------
Our project addresses these challenges through a system that aims to:

* We are using diverse data streams (news sentiment, social media, technical analysis) to have deeper market insights
* Develop and optimize machine learning models for rapid market analysis and prediction
* Implement a robust decision engine that operates independently of human emotional biases
* Build a modular and maintainable architecture that provides clear visibility into the trading logic and decision process
